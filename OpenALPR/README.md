Python program which uses OpenALPR to find the characters of a number plate in a given frame.

It utilises methods such as Plate Localisation, Plate orientation and sizing, Normalisation, 
Character segmentation and Optical Character Recognition.

The program outputs the plate's characters and provides a confidence level.

There are a tonne of dependancies needed for OpenALPR including :
  Tesseract, OpenCV, libtronic....
